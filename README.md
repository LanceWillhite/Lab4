Lab Four for OOP

The two patterns implemented are a factory patter and observer pattern. The factory pattern will be used to abstract instantiation of different types of event objects. The observer pattern will be used to allow the eventListPanel to react to changes in event plans.

The eventFactory gets rid of the direct instantion of meeting and deadline objects
The event class will not be a subject that maintains a list of observers.
